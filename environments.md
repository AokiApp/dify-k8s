### Server

#### MODE

Startup mode: This is only available when launched using docker. It is not applicable when running from source code.

- api

  Start API Server.

- worker

  Start asynchronous queue worker.

#### DEBUG

Debug mode: Disabled by default. It's recommended to enable this setting during local development to prevent issues caused by monkey patching.

#### FLASK_DEBUG

Flask debug mode: When enabled, it outputs trace information in the API responses, facilitating easier debugging.

#### SECRET_KEY
